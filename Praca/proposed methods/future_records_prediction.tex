\section{Future record prediction}
\label{record_prediction}

This task is most important while also hardest to train. Our goal is to create model which would be able to predict potential next record based on patient previous ones. This task in general is almost impossible with amount of information we have, since there are many other factors that determine whether, when and what new disease will the patient become infected with in the future, whether his current state will improve or worsen, and most importantly what specific steps will doctor take.
\\

Fortunately our ultimate goal is not to predict specific patient future but only estimate how much would he most likely cost. So we expect that even though we wouldn't predict what exactly happens we would be able to estimate total cost of those records.
\\

We try multiple different model for this prediction. First three models we tried were Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN). More specifically we tried multi-layer Elman RNN, multi-layered Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) RNN and multi-layer Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) RNN, architecture of these models is explained in Sec. \ref{theoryRNN}. Last model we tried was Transformer explained in Sec. \ref{theoryTrans}, more specifically we tried Decoder-only Transformer model.
