\section{Record cost prediction}
\label{recCostPred}

The next step in total cost prediction involves estimating the cost of individual records. This is necessary because the future records we predict lack cost information, requiring an additional model to determine it. We adopted this approach to leverage the entire record for prediction, rather than relying solely on a single cost dimension that could have been added. For this task, we selected a standard Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), a multi-layered, fully-connected feed-forward neural network, whose architecture is detailed in Sec. \ref{MLP}.
\\

We also trained a Gradient Boosting model and a Ridge regression model for comparative analysis. These were chosen to represent two distinct model families: decision trees (Gradient Boosting) and linear regression (Ridge). We selected these specific representatives because they employ more sophisticated techniques than base models in their respective groups and have demonstrated performance comparable to, if not better than, artificial neural networks in similar studies, such as the work by Mohammad Amin Morid et al. \cite{morid2018supervised} (discussed in Chap. \ref{simStudy}).
