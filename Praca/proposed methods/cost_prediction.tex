\section{Record Cost Prediction}
\label{recCostPred}

Next step in total cost prediction is to predict how much each record would cost. For this we choose standard multilayer perceptron (MLP) or in another words multi-layered fully-connected feed-forward neural network, we explained architecture of this model in Sec. \ref{MLP}. 
\\

We also tried to train Gradient Boosting model and Ridge model to have a comparison. We choose these models for comparison to have representative from both decision tree and linear regression models, and we choose specifically these representative from each model group since they utilize more complex techniques than base models in their group and they were on par if not better than Artificial Neural Network in similar study by Mohammad Amin Morid at al. \cite{morid2018supervised} which we cover in Chap. \ref{simStudy}.
