\section{Record Cost Prediction}
\label{recCostPred}

Next step in total cost prediction is to predict how much each record would cost. For this we choose standard multilayer perceptron (MLP) or in another words multi-layered fully-connected feed-forward neural network, we explained architecture of this model in Sec. \ref{MLP}. 
\\

We also tried to train Gradient Boosting model and Ridge model to have a comparison.
