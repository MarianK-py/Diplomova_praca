\chapter{Proposed method}

Task of predicting future cost of a patient can be split input multiple sub-tasks which follow each other. The sub-tasks are these:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Embed patient history into numerical vectors
	\item Compute expected number of records patient would have in next year
	\item Predict future records for patient
	\item Predict cost of each future record
	\item Complete total cost of patient for next year
\end{enumerate}
