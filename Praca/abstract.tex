Currently, the healthcare sector in Slovakia is characterized by a low rate of utilization of available healthcare data. The aim of this work is to show that from existing data it is possible to predict the development of the patient's further health status, or to estimate the development of future costs in order to better plan the redistribution of finances within the sector.
