\chapter{Medical data} \label{chap:data}

Our models were developed for a database of health insurance claims maintained by the Slovak National Health Information Center (NCZI). We focused primarily on datasets related to drug prescriptions and medical procedures administered by outpatient healthcare providers.
\\

To train and verify model we used completely artificial data with matching structure to data in NCZI database. The data were generated in a manner that simulates realistic patient records.
\\

Data we have can be split into two categories, those are patients records and mapping table. 

\section{Patients records}

Patients records are split into two dataset:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Records of medical procedures from outpatient healthcare
	\item Records of prescribed drugs
\end{itemize}

In total we have data about 173355 patients. Each patient have at least 70 records.

\subsection{Records of medical procedures from ambulatory health care}

Each row of this dataset is equivalent to single patient record, meaning single medical procedure done to them, in total this dataset consist of (ADD NUMBER HERE) records. Each record consist of these variable:
\begin{itemize}
	\item date of the procedure - date when procedure was performed
	\item code of the patient - identification code unique for the patient
	\item age of the patient - age of the patient at the time of procedure
	\item gender of the patient
	\item code of the diagnosis - identification code unique for the diagnosis for which procedure was prescribed
	\item code of the procedure - identification code unique for the medical procedure 
	\item cost of the procedure - cost associated with performing of the procedure
\end{itemize}

For our prediction we use most of these information, date of the procedure combined with patient age is used to create timestamp information used to order all records for patient as well as one of the dimension of record embedding. Identification code of patient is used to be able to gather all records for single patient. Identification codes for diagnosis and procedure are matched with their corresponding numerical vector and embedded into vector corresponding to record (see \ref{embedding}). Cost is encoded into cost category and used as information of cost associated with embedding of record.

\subsection{Records of prescribed medicines}

Similarly to dataset containing procedures, each row is equivalent to single patient record, in this case it's single drug prescription for that specific patient, in total we have (ADD NUMBER HERE) records of prescribed drugs. Each record consist of these variable:
\begin{itemize}
	\item date of the prescription - date when drug was prescribed
	\item code of the patient - identification code unique for the patient
	\item age of the patient - age of the patient at the time of procedure
	\item gender of the patient
	\item code of the diagnosis - identification code unique for the diagnosis for which drug was prescribed
	\item code of the drug - identification code unique for the drug 
	\item cost of the drug - cost associated with performing of the procedure
\end{itemize}

Use of these variable is also similar to procedures, with only difference that instead of using encoding procedure into record embedding we encode drug.

\section{Mappings}

Other than datasets containing patients data we use three mapping files to map identification codes used for attributes in patients records datasets to corresponding embedding vectors. Mapping datasets are:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Diagnosis mapping
	\item Drug mapping
	\item Medical procedure mapping
\end{itemize}

These datasets are publicly available dimensional table from maintained and used by NCZI. In general all three mapping table have comparable structure consisting of three main attributes. First is internal identification number used by NCZI to join these mappings on patients records. Then second attribute is official code, in case of drugs and diagnosis it's an internationally standardized structured code while medical procedures uses code specific for Slovakia which unfortunately lack any kind of meaningful structure. Final last important part is textual description. 
\\

We used these dimensional table to generate embedding vectors for drugs, diagnosis and medical procedures. Process of this embedding is explained in section \ref{embeddingImple}.
