\chapter{Software design} \label{chap:softwaredesign}

Whole code was written using Python language. We chose this language for its ease of use and extensive support for data processing and machine learning.
\\

Whole code can be split into three parts:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Embedding - code to add embedded vectors into mapping files, has to be run once 
	\item Model training and validation - code to setup, train, validate and save prediction models, has to be run once 
	\item Predictor - code to load trained models and predict future cost of inputted patients 
\end{enumerate}
