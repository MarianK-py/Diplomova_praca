\chapter{Software Design} \label{chap:softwaredesign}

This chapter is dedicated to introduce software used to create, train, validate and used machine learning model described in this thesis.
Whole code was written using Python language, more specifically in \texttt{Python 3.11.4}. We chose this language for its ease of use and wide selection of libraries for data processing and machine learning. All scripts are available at the GitHub repository \url{https://github.com/MarianK-py/diploma_thesis_code}.
\\

Whole code can be split into three parts:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Embedding - code to add create embedding mapping files
	\item Model training and validation - code to setup, train, validate and save prediction models, has to be run once 
	\item Predictor - code to load trained models and predict future cost of inputted patients 
\end{enumerate}

Now we will introduce libraries and pre-trained models used in our code. Firstly ones used in general and then specific ones used in each part mentioned above.

\section{General}

Some of the libraries were used in all parts of code to maintain some coherence in technologies used. 
\\

To this category belong \texttt{Pandas 2.2.1} library a fast, powerful, flexible and easy to use open source data analysis and manipulation tool \cite{pandas} which was used to load, manipulate and save all datasets. Another one is \texttt{Numpy 1.26.4} library an open source project that enables numerical computing with Python \cite{numpy} which we use for computations such as random number generation, computations of mean and standard deviation for data normalization and many more.
