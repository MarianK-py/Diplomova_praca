\section{Embedding}
\label{embedDesign}

For embedding we used couple additional libraries since we utilized couple of algorithms and pre-trained models. More specifically libraries and specific algorithms and models we used are these: 
\\

\begin{itemize}
	\item \texttt{Scikit-learn 1.2.2} - simple and efficient tools for predictive data analysis \cite{scikitlearn},  we specifically use function to compute PCA in order to decrease dimensionality of medical procedure embedding and function K-means clustering in order to check embedding has desired property
	
	\item \texttt{NTLK}
	
	\item \texttt{Simplemma}
	
	\item \texttt{SentenceTransformer}
	
	\item \texttt{Gensim}
\end{itemize}



Simplemma (lemmatizer)

sentence transformers (LaBSE)

gensim (word2vec)

ntlk (word tokenizer)
